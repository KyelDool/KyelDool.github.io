        "description":"My first goal after graduating college was to buff up all the skills that I felt I had missed out on during college. The first being PCB design.
            I felt that learning some PCB design would not only be a great skill to have while looking for a career, but would also widen my options when creating
            future projects. For my first PCB I followed an amazing tutorial on using kiCAD; A free to use CAD software. For this project I designed a PCB board that
             functions as a name tag. The board has a small white space to place your name and has flashing LEDs controlled by a 555 timer for flair. After creating the design,
              I ordered the board from oshpark and ordered all of my parts from, digikey. After all my parts came I soldered the PCB. Below is a gif of the final product.",
